  heading: What we offer
  description: >-
    Assessing incoming data and making decisions on output is a sensory bodily
    activity and educational awareness of how people interpret life is
    important.

    People don’t know how they function, are unaware of how much time + energy
    is used up, and hold their breath for processing information which explains
    why health problems arise in life.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
